**Data Visualization**

**Project Overview**

This task focuses on creating bar charts and histograms to visually represent the distribution of categorical and continuous variables in a dataset. Data visualization is an essential step in data analysis as it helps identify patterns, trends, and anomalies that may not be obvious from raw data alone.

By using Python visualization libraries, we transform complex datasets into intuitive visual insights that can guide decision-making and further exploration.

**Objectives**

Load and prepare the dataset for visualization.

Create a bar chart to visualize the distribution of categorical variables.

Create a histogram to visualize the distribution of continuous variables.

Interpret visual insights to understand patterns and trends in the data.

**Tools & Technologies**

Python

Pandas – for data handling

Matplotlib / Seaborn – for creating visualizations

Jupyter Notebook – for an interactive workflow

**Dataset**

For this task, you can use any dataset containing categorical and continuous variables.
Example datasets:

Titanic Dataset (Kaggle)

Superstore Sales Dataset

Custom CSV file

**Visualizations Created**

Bar Chart – Displays the frequency/count of each category in a categorical column (e.g., gender, product category).

Histogram – Shows the distribution of a continuous variable (e.g., age, sales amount).
